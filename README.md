# Hello World

My name is Zahra Ayman Almarzooq.

I am a student with a background in computer science.

I am interested in Machine Learning because I want to learn how machines can analyze data and make predictions.

This repository is created for Lab 1 in the Machine Learning course.

## Problem Statement

This project aims to build a machine learning classification model to predict whether a bank customer will churn or not based on their personal and account-related information. The dataset includes customer demographics and banking attributes, and the target variable indicates whether the customer has left the bank.
